When you log out of the "app", you have to sign up again as the data isn't permanently loaded into the json array of obejcts. This website doesn't take a lot of data from you and does not use machine learning or any AI algorithm so the results won't be that accurate but they'll be realistic and satisfying. I use simple probability. All you have to do is sign up, login, and enter your subjects with your results. Then answer two more questions and you will get a popup of your chances of finishing the current course you're busy with.
